# sudoku

Sudoku is a group project for Object Oriented Programming course in the fourth semester, where students were asked to create a game using the concept of Object Oriented Programming. The game was developed using Eclipse IDE 2020-6 and specifically in Java 8 version 291. The repository contains both the folder of the project and the executable file (.exe) of the Sudoku game.

# A Brief Explanation and Instructions on Installation
Sudoku is a puzzle game where players need to insert and arrange the number 1 to 9 in a board containing 9 by 9 cells. The rules are each row, columns, and squares (an area containing 3 by 3 cells) cannot contain a repeating number.

Before installing the executable file (.exe) of the Sudoku game, the user needs to install or have java 8 installed into the system. The java 8 installer can be downloaded through [this link](https://java.com/en/download/).

After installing java 8, download the executable file (.exe) that can be seen as below. The file can be placed anywhere within the system and the player can play Sudoku directly by opening the executable file.
