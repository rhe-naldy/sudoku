Sudoku is a group project for Object Oriented Programming course in the fourth semester, where students were asked to create a game using the concept of Object Oriented Programming. The game was developed using Eclipse IDE 2020-6 and specifically in Java 8 version 291. The repository contains both the folder of the project and the executable file (.exe) of the Sudoku game.
